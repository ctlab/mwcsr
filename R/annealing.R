#' ctor for annealing solver
#'
#' Simulated annealing is a heuristic method of solving optimization problems.
#' Typically, it allows to find some good solution in a short time. This
#' implementation doesn't compute any upper bound on solution, so there is no
#' guarantee of optimality of solution provided.
#'
#' Algorithm maintains connected subgraph staring with empty subgraph.
#' Each iteration one random action is considered. It may be a removal of a
#' vertex or an edge which does not separate graph or addition of an extra vertex or
#' an edge neighboring existing graph. If the subgraph is empty all vertices
#' are considered as candidates to form a subgaph. After candidate is chosen two
#' subgraph scores are considered: for a new subgraph and for an old one. Simulated
#' annealing operates with a notion of temperature. The candidate action is
#' accepted with probability: p(S'|S) = exp(-E / T), where E is weight difference
#' between subgraphs and T is current temperature.
#'
#' Temperature is calculated in each iteration. in `mwcsr` there are two
#' temperature schedules supported. So called Boltmann annealing uses the formula:
#' T(k) = T0 / (ln(1 + k)), while in case of fast annealing this one is used:
#' T(k) = T0 / k, where k is iteration number.
#'
#' To tune the algorithm it is useful to realize how typical changes in the goal
#' function for single actions are distributed. Calculating the acceptance probabilities
#' at initial temperature and final temperatures may help to choose schedule and
#' temperatures.
