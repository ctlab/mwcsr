`mwcsr` is an R package to solve maximum weight connected subgraph (MWCS) problem and its
variants. The package implements and provides an interface to several solvers: both exact and heuristic.


## Installation

`mwcsr` can be installed from GitHub repository using `devtools` package:

```{r eval=F}
library(devtools)
install_github("ctlab/mwcsr")
```

## Quick start

Load `mwcsr`, as well as `igraph` package, which contains functions for graph manipulations.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(mwcsr)
library(igraph)
```

Let's load an example instance of MWCS problem. The instance is a simple `igraph` object with `weight` vertex attribute.

```{r}
data("mwcs_example")
print(mwcs_example)
summary(V(mwcs_example)$weight)
```

Now let us initialize a heuristic relax-and-cut MWCS solver (Alvarez-Miranda and Sinnl, 2017):

```{r}
rcsolver <- rmwcs_solver()
```

Now we can use this solver to solve the example instance:

```{r}
m <- solve_mwcsp(rcsolver, mwcs_example)
print(m$graph)
print(m$weight)
```


## Supported problem types

Supported MWCS variants are:

* classic (simple) MWCS, where only vertices are weighted;
* generalized MWCS (GMWCS), where both vertices and edges are weighted;
* signal generalized MWCS (SGMWCS), where both vertices and edges are marked with weighted "signals", and a weight of a subgraph is calculated as a sum of weights of its unique signals.

In `mwcsr`, instances of all of the above prolbems are represented by an `igraph` object
with certain specified attributes.
The validity and the type of the instance 
can be checked using `get_instance_type` function, for example:

```{r}
get_instance_type(mwcs_example)
```

### Simple MWCS

Simple maximum weight connected subgraph (MWCS) problem can be defined as follows.
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph and $\omega : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
is a weight function defined on the vertices. Then MWCS problem consists in
finding a connected subgraph $\widetilde{G} = (\widetilde{V}, \widetilde{E})$ 
witha a maximal total sum of vertex weights:

$$\Omega(\widetilde{G}) = \sum_{v \in \widetilde{V}} \omega(v) \rightarrow max.$$

An important property of MWCS is that solution can always be represented as a tree.

In `mwcsr` an MWCS instance is defined as an `igraph` with `weight` vertex attribute
(and without `weight` edge attribute).

```{r}
mwcs_example
summary(V(mwcs_example)$weight)
```


### Generalized MWCS (GMWCS)

Generalized MWCS (GMWCS) is similar to MWCS, but edges are also weighted.
More formally, 
let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph and $\omega : (V \cup E) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
is a weight function defined on the vertices and the edges.
Then GMWCS problem consists in
finding a connected subgraph $\widetilde{G} = (\widetilde{V}, \widetilde{E})$ 
with a a maximal total sum of vertex and edge weights:

$$
\Omega(\widetilde{G}) = \sum_{v \in \widetilde{V}} \omega(v) + 
\sum_{e \in \widetilde{E}} \omega(e) \rightarrow max.
$$

An important consequence of edge weights is that the optimal solution can contain cycles. 

A GMWCS instance is defined as an `igraph` with `weight` attribute defined
for both vertices and edges.

```{r}
data(gmwcs_example)
gmwcs_example
summary(V(gmwcs_example)$weight)
summary(E(gmwcs_example)$weight)
```


### Signal generalized MWCS (SGMWCS)

The signal generalized MWCS (SGMWCS) variant continues to generalize MWCS problem
and introduces a concept of _signals_.
Insted of specifying vertex and edge weights
directly, the weights are defined for a set of signals, and vertis and edges are marked
with these signals.
The difference from GMWCS is that the signals can be repeated in
the graph, while the weight of the subgraph is defined as a sum of weights of its
unique signals.

Formally, let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph, 
$S$ -- a set of signlas with weights $\omega: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$,
and $\sigma: (V \cup E) \rightarrow 2^S$ -- markings of the vertices and edges 
with signals.
An SGMWCS problem consists in finding a connected subgraph,
with a maximal total sum of its unique signals:

$$
\Omega(\widetilde{G}) = 
    \sum_{s \in \sigma(\widetilde{V} \cup \widetilde{E})} \omega(s) \rightarrow max,
$$
where $\sigma(\widetilde{V} \cup \widetilde{E}) = 
\bigcup_{x \in (\widetilde{V} \cup \widetilde{E})} \sigma(x)$.

SGMWCS instances can arise when the data, from which the weights are inferred, map
to the graph ambigously. 
For example, when m/z peak from mass-spectrometry data is assigned to multiple
isomer metabolites, or when the same enzyme catalyze multiple reactions, and so on.
Practically, it is usually assumed that the signals with negative weights are not repeated.


An SGMWCS is represented as an `igraph` object, with `signal` attribute defined
for both vertices and edges and a `signals` attribute defined for the graph, containing
the signal weights. Specification of multiple signals per node or edge is not yet supported.

```{r}
data("sgmwcs_example")
sgmwcs_example
str(V(sgmwcs_example)$signal)
str(E(sgmwcs_example)$signal)
head(sgmwcs_example$signals)
```


#### Constructing SGMWCS instances

Sometimes, construction of SGMWCS isntances can be simplified using `normalize_sgmwcs_instance` function.

Let consider an example graph obtained from [gatom](https://github.com/ctlab/gatom) package.

```{r}
load(system.file("gatom_example.rda", package='mwcsr'))
print(gatom_example)
```

In this graph, the `signals` graph attributed is absent with weights specified directly
as vertex or edge attributes along with `signal` attributes, which is a very practical intermediate representation. However, it is recognized as a GMWCS instance:

```{r}
get_instance_type(gatom_example)
```

Let convert this representation into a valid SGMWCS instance using
`normalize_sgmwcs_instance` function:

```{r}
gatom_instance <- normalize_sgmwcs_instance(gatom_example)
get_instance_type(gatom_instance)
```

And let call the same function with explicit arguments:
```{r}
gatom_instance <- normalize_sgmwcs_instance(gatom_example,
                                            nodes.weight.column = "weight",
                                            edges.weight.column = "weight",
                                            nodes.group.by = "signal",
                                            edges.group.by = "signal", 
                                            group.only.positive = TRUE)
```

The function does the following:

1. It extracts signal weights from the specified columns. 
`NULL` can be specified as a value of `nodes.group.by` or `edges.group.by` if
there are no corresponding signals in the data, in which case zero signals will be 
created.
2. It splits input signals with negative weights into mulpliple unique signals,
unless `group.only.positive` is set to `FALSE`.


## Supported solvers

Currently, three solvers are supported:

* heuristic relax-and-cut solver `rmwcs_solver` for MWCS;
* heuristic simmulated annealing solver `annealing_solver` for MWCS/GMWCS/SGMWCS;
* exact (if CPLEX library is available) or heuristic (without CPLEX) solver `virgo_solver` 
for MWCS/GMWCS/SGMWCS. 

While selecting a particular solver depends on the particular class of instances, 
the general recommendations are:

* For MWCS use `rmwcs_solver` if small suboptimality can be tolerated.
It is very fast and usually is able to find optimal or very close to optimal solution. To find exact solution `virgo_solver` can be used if CPLEX library is available.
* For GMWCS and SGMWCS `virgo_solver` is the recommended solver if CPLEX library is available. 
Without CPLEX the solutions by `virgo_solver` will be suboptimal. 
Better solutions in the absense of CPLEX can be achieved by tuning `annealing_solver`.


### Relax-and-cut solver

Relax-and-cut solver is a huristic solver able to rapidly find high-quality solutions
for MWCS problem (Alvarez-Miranda and Sinnl, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2017.05.015). 
The solver does not require any additional libraries.

Relax-and-cut solver can be constructed using `rmwcs_solver` function with the default arguemnts.
As it is heuristic solver, the solved to optimality flag is always set to `FALSE`.

```{r}
rcsolver <- rmwcs_solver()
m <- solve_mwcsp(rcsolver, mwcs_example)
print(m$weight)
print(m$solved_to_optimality)
```


### Simulated annealing solver

Another heuristic solver is a simulted annealing based solver.
The solver is rather generic, but can produce good enogh solutions 
if parameters are tuned well.
As it is heuristic solver, the solved to optimality flag is always set to `FALSE`.


```{r}
asolver <- annealing_solver()
m <- solve_mwcsp(asolver, gmwcs_example)
print(m$weight)
print(m$solved_to_optimality)
```
    

### Java-based Virgo solver

The `mwcsr` package provides interface to exact Java-based Virgo solver  
(https://github.com/ctlab/virgo-solver) which can be used to solve
MWCS, GMWCS and SGMWCS instances. 
The solver requires Java (11+) to be installed on your machine.

There are two modes of execution:

1. Heuristic -- which finds a solutio based on minimal spanning tree heuristic and does not require any additional setup;
2. Exact -- which uses CPLEX library to solve the instances to provable optimality.
CPLEX can be downloaded from the official web-site:
https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio.
Free licence can be obtained for academic purposes.

Heuristic solver can be constructed, by specyfing `cplex_dir=NULL`. 
As it is heuristic solver, the solved to optimality flag is always set to `FALSE`.

```{r}
mst_solver <- virgo_solver(cplex_dir=NULL)
m <- solve_mwcsp(mst_solver, sgmwcs_example)
print(m$weight)
print(m$solved_to_optimality)
```

Exact solver requires setting `cplex_dir` argument with a path to CPLEX installation.
The `cplex_dir` requires, that `cplex.jar` file and CPLEX dynamic library
file (depending on the operating system: `libcplex<version>.dll` for Windows,
`libcplex<version>.so` for Linux, `libcplex<version>.jnilib` for OS X) 
can be found there with recursive search.
Alternatively, `cplex_jar` argument pointing to `cplex.jar` file and `cplex_bin` argument 
pointing to the directory with CPLEX dynamic library files can be specified.
Additionally, it is conveniet to put the path to CPLEX into a `CPLEX_HOME`
environment variale, so that it does not have to be changed from 
one system to another, when run.

```{r}
cplex_dir <- Sys.getenv('CPLEX_HOME')
exact_solver <- virgo_solver(cplex_dir=cplex_dir)
m <- solve_mwcsp(exact_solver, sgmwcs_example)
```

As the CPLEX fount the optimal solution, the corresponding flag is set to `TRUE`:

```{r}
print(m$weight)
print(m$solved_to_optimality)
```

Some additional information like the running time, instance files, solver version
is available as in the `stats` field. 
Refer to Virgo documentation for the description of the values.


```{r}
print(m$stats)
```

Computational resources availble for Virgo can be specified with the following parameters:

* `memory` -- maximum amount of memory, more specifically Java heap size, specified via `-Xmx` Java option, default: `2G`.
* `threads` -- number of threads for simultaneous computation, default: the number of available cores.
* `timelimit` -- maximum time in seconds to solve the problem, if the solver is interrupted
due to time limit, the best solution found so far is reported and `solved_to_optimality` flag is set to `FALSE`.

Another useful paramter is `penalty`. The non-zero penalty make the solver run an additional
pass over the solution, with each edge penalized with the specified value. 
As there can be multiple solutions, having the same weight, especially in case of SGMWCS,
this procedure allows to locally minimize the solution size, while preserving the weight.

```{r}
psolver <- virgo_solver(cplex_dir=cplex_dir, penalty=0.001)
min_m <- solve_mwcsp(psolver, sgmwcs_example)
print(min_m$weight)
print(min_m$stats)
```

Now the solution, has `r min_m$stats$nodes` nodes instead of `r m$stats$nodes` 
for the solution that was found before, while having the same total weight
of `r min_m$weight`.


### SCIP-jack solver

You can also use R interface to SCIP-jack solver. To use it you need to download
SCIPOptSuite from the [official web-site](https://scipopt.org/#scipoptsuite)
and build `scipstp` application.
Beware, that `scipstp` is not provided in the pre-built SCIPOptSuite version, so
you have to build it manually from source.

Quick build instructions:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# in scipoptsuite source directory
cmake -Bbuild -H.
cmake --build build --target scipstp
# optionally copy scipstp file somewhere to $PATH
cp build/applications/scipstp /usr/local/bin/
```

For complete build and configuration instructions for this solver 
visit [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/INSTALL_APPLICATIONS_EXAMPLES.php) website.

After installing and ensuring that scipstp application is correctly built,
you can access `scipjack_solver` class to solve MWCS instances:
```{r message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
scip <- scipjack_solver(scipstp_bin=Sys.which("scipstp"))
sol <- solve_mwcsp(scip, mwcs_example)
```

The optimization parameters are passed using \href{https://www.scipopt.org/doc-6.0.2/html/PARAMETERS.php}{SCIPopt} config file. You can modify bundled file or
create a new one to fine-tune the solver.

## Integration with BioNet

This part of the turorial shows how `mwcsr` solvers can be combined 
with `BioNet` package to find an actime module in a protein-protein interaction
network.

Let start with generating an example scored network, following BioNet tutorial:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(BioNet)
library(DLBCL)
data(dataLym)
data(interactome)
pvals <- cbind(t = dataLym$t.pval, s = dataLym$s.pval)
rownames(pvals) <- dataLym$label
pval <- aggrPvals(pvals, order = 2, plot = FALSE)
logFC <- dataLym$diff
names(logFC) <- dataLym$label
subnet <- subNetwork(dataLym$label, interactome)
subnet <- rmSelfLoops(subnet)
fb <- fitBumModel(pval, plot = FALSE)
scores <- scoreNodes(subnet, fb, fdr = 0.001)
```

Here we have network object `subnet` of type `graphNEL` and a vector of node scores `scores`:

```{r}
subnet
str(scores)
```

BioNet comes with a heuristic MWCS FastHeinz solver, that we can use to find the module
following the BioNet tutorial:

```{r}
bionet_h <- runFastHeinz(subnet, scores)
plotModule(bionet_h, scores=scores, diff.expr=logFC)
sum(scores[nodes(bionet_h)])
```

We can construct an MWCS instance by converting `graphNEL` object into
`igraph` and add node weights: 

```{r}
bionet_example <- igraph.from.graphNEL(subnet, weight=FALSE) # ignoring edge weights of 1
V(bionet_example)$weight <- scores[V(bionet_example)]
get_instance_type(bionet_example)
```

Now the instance can be solved with the relax-and-cut solver:

```{r}
rmwcs <- rmwcs_solver()
bionet_m <- solve_mwcsp(rmwcs, bionet_example)
plotModule(bionet_m$graph, scores=scores, diff.expr=logFC)
```

Note that the weight increased, compared to FastHeinz solution:

```{r}
print(bionet_m$weight)
```

Similarly, Virgo can be used to solve the instance to provable optimality, 
but in this case it produces the same results:

```{r}
bionet_m_exact <- solve_mwcsp(exact_solver, bionet_example)
print(bionet_m_exact$weight)
print(bionet_m_exact$solved_to_optimality)
```
